requirements:


1) show current movies and the shows.
2) change location
3) search different types of movies
4) each movie will be listed for different shows.
5) registered user should be able to buy 10 number of tickets.


1) theatre can edit/add a show.

we are building a MVP - minimum viable product where we can extend based on 
future requirements.

so we make some assumptions.
1) Single screen
2) each screen will have limited seats
3) registered can book and guest can search
4) Registered user will have booking history - so he can cancel the tickets.
5) Bi-linguial - English and Hindi
6) categories - Horror, comedy, action, Romance
Not considering payment for now.

we can consider the extension use-cases once the MVP is ready.
Create abstract class of User because the objects will be created from the 
registered user and the Guest user only. 
 
multi-screens ? seat-selection ? payments ? multi-lingual languages ? 
support location based search of theatres ?
How shall we handle concurrency ?
