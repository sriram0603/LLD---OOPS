4 Big Things:

1) User/Customers
    whio will use ?
    how the system will use ? 
2) Scale(read and write)
    how much read queries ?
    traffic spikes ?
    how big ?
3) performance
    what is write-to-read data delay ?
    what is the expected latency for read queries ?
4) cost
    should minimize cost of development ?
    should minimize cost of maintenance ?

Top priority in non-functional requirements should be:
1) Scalability 
2) Availability
3) perfromance.
