Tier ----
The main upside of single-tier applications is they have no network latency since 
every component is located on the same machine. This adds up to the performance 
of the software.
One big downside of single-tier app is that the business has no control over the 
application. Once the software is shipped, no code or features changes can possibly 
be done until the customer manually updates it by connecting to the 
remote server or by downloading & installing a patch.
An N-tier application is an application which has more than three components involved.
componenets like:
    Cache
    Message queues for asynchronous behaviour
    Load balancers
    Search servers for searching through massive amounts of data
    Components involved in processing massive amounts of data
    Components running heterogeneous tech commonly known as web services etc.
Why N-tiers ?
beacuse of design principles Single responsibility principle and the 
seperation of of concerns.
Thin client and thick clients.
HTTP protocol
